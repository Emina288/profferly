              I just moved to the area and was itching for some volunteering
              work. I got involved with GrowNYC, an organization that helps to
              feed New Yorkers, and met so many people from my new neighborhood!
              I immediately felt welcomed into my new community and I love how I
              working towards a cause helped to bring us together. I'm proud to
              say that I'm officially a part of the fresh produce movement.
              Thanks, profferly!

              Hey! Oldie but goodie here. Was advised by my doctor to avoid
              large crowds until a vaccine for coronavirus has been approved and
              I'm out of food. Can someone please help me get groceries?

              I had so much fun today volunteering for Sea Turtle Conservation
              today! I love animals and I thank profferly for connecting me with
              so many amazing volunteering opporunties near me! I get to
              continue my life mission of helping one animal at a time, for a
              better world ðŸŒŽ
